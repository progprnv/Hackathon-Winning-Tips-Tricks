# STEP 0 - "THE MOST IMPORTANT THING"

1) Know your time-frame 

2) Dont try to make complicated features. Start from building a small stuff ... then update concurrently.

3) Think of an idea which can be built simple & USEFUL TO SOCIETY (yes i meant abt ur ayalvasis and nattukar "A SACRIFICE IS INDEED NEEDED" GIVE UP FOR THEM, only for this goddammm heckethoonnn!!

4) The simple idea u guys thought of should be able to solve a vast problem.

   KEY FEATURES OF A SIMPLE IDEA:
     > LESS TIME COMPLEXITY
     > This means your project (ie solution to the problem statement) must make a drastic change in any of the parameters -- TIME , USAGE , AVAILIBILITY , Can your project would be implemented in less span of time?
     
5)  Ask Questions to urself!! DO ANY HOOMANS WILL USE YOUR APP or WEBSITE TO MITIGATE THEIR PROBLEM? if not, vere idea kandu pidikananm mister!!!

6) First 5 process ... call it as "RECON" (chumma oru fun :)

7) OK AFTER RECON, Think of these qns
---- WHY   ++
---- WHEN   ++
---- WHERE   ++
              ++ TO USE YOUR PROJECT

9) THE SECOND MOST IMP Question is "WHY" & "WHEN" PEOPLE WILL USE YOUR PROJECT ?

   * It should completely solve their problem or atmost atleast 90 % 
   * 
10) If the hackathon is a STARTUP IDEATION then think of a project which is innovative and at the same time it should generate some revenue.

11) Logic Reasoning and Kooman SENSE-- USE IT WISELY EVEN IF U DONT HAVE (like me fr*)

12) USE PUBLIC API (if there is no restriction)
--- Use this below repo to make your work super easy with apis.

13) FOR NICHE HACKATHONS
--- Try to make a truly different and unique ideas enough to make your team stand out among other teams
--- Study about past winning projects or submissions of that particular hackathon. This will increase your understanding of what invigilator or the judges are expecting from your team.
